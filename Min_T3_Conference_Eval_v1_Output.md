# PART 1: THE BOOTH SETUP

## The Physical Space

10x10 standard booth. No premium island, no raised floor. Jon has to compete with Orion's 20x30 island booth two aisles over and Practifi's polished setup near the entrance. This is an insurgent's booth — it wins on substance, not spectacle.

**Layout:**
- **Back wall:** 8-foot fabric backdrop with signage (see below)
- **Left side:** 55" monitor on a stand, angled 15° toward foot traffic (critical — most attendees approach from the left coming from the main pavilion)
- **Right side:** Standing-height demo station (laptop + 24" monitor) where Jon runs live demos
- **Front-left corner:** Small table with collateral stack, QR code stand, business card bowl
- **Front-right:** Open space — no table blocking entry. People can walk in without committing

**Staffing:** Jon at the demo station. Second person: **Not a hired booth assistant.** Bring **a current or former RIA COO** — ideally someone from the pilot cohort or advisory network. Name: "Sarah," 15 years in RIA ops, now consulting. Her job: stand near the monitor, engage people who pause at the attract screen, and say one of two things depending on the person's badge:

- If badge says COO, Director of Ops, or Operations: "You run ops? Come look at this."
- If badge says Advisor, CEO, or anything else: "Have you seen what your ops team deals with every day?"

Sarah's real value: when someone asks "does this actually work?" she can say "I've seen it work" with genuine authority. She's not a salesperson. She's a peer.

## 1. The Booth Signage

**Back wall, top center, 72-point font:**

> **Your ops team is drowning. Min sees why.**

That's 8 words. Readable from 20 feet. It does three things:
- **"Your ops team"** — immediate audience filter. If you don't have an ops team, this isn't for you. If you do, you just felt a jolt of recognition.
- **"is drowning"** — emotional truth. Every COO at T3 is drowning. This isn't aspirational marketing. It's a mirror.
- **"Min sees why"** — the product does something. It's not a dashboard. It's not a workflow tool. It *sees.* That word does the work of promising intelligence without explaining it.

**Below, 36-point font:**

> **Operations intelligence for RIAs**

This is the category anchor. "Operations intelligence" is a new category — it doesn't exist yet, and that's the point. Anyone who reads it will think: "I know what operations is, I know what intelligence means, but I don't have that."

**Bottom of backdrop, subtle but legible:**

> **min.tech**

No tagline. No feature list. No "powered by AI." The back wall has 12 words total.

---

## 2. The Attract Mode Screen

The 55" monitor runs a continuous loop — no screensaver, no slide deck, no video. A **live product view** that rotates through three states on a 20-second cycle:

### Screen A (0-20 seconds): "The Wall"

A simplified triage queue showing 6-8 flagged items across 3 accounts. Each item shows:
- Account name (redacted to fictional names: "Harrison Family Trust," "Meridian Partners LLC")
- The signal: "NIGO detected — missing beneficiary designation," "Drift alert — allocation 4.2% off target," "Billing discrepancy — $347 fee mismatch"
- A severity indicator (red/amber/green dot)
- Time in queue: "Detected 2h ago," "Detected 4d ago"

**Why this works from 15 feet:** It looks like a mission control screen. Dense but organized. The red dots pull the eye. A COO walking past sees something that looks like the inside of her own nightmare — a list of things going wrong — and her feet stop because she thinks: *how does that screen know about those problems?*

### Screen B (20-40 seconds): "The X-Ray"

A single account health score view. One account, expanded:
- **Account name:** "Whitfield Family — $4.2M, Schwab + Fidelity"
- **Health Score: 72/100** (amber)
- **4 active signals** listed beneath:
  - "Beneficiary designation missing on Schwab IRA" (red)
  - "RMD not scheduled for 2025" (amber)
  - "Fee schedule mismatch vs. ADV" (amber)
  - "Model drift: 3.8% from target" (yellow)
- **Source attribution** visible for each signal: "Source: Schwab custodial feed, detected Jan 14"

**Why this works:** It communicates depth. The first screen shows breadth (many problems across many accounts). This one shows that Min can drill into a single account and show you exactly what's wrong and *where the data came from.* The source attribution line is critical — it whispers "this isn't a guess, this is provenance."

### Screen C (40-60 seconds): "The Save"

A before/after split:
- **Left panel labeled "Before Min":** A stylized representation of an ops workflow — email chain, spreadsheet, custodian portal screenshot, handwritten note. Cluttered. Anxious. Time-stamped over 3 days.
- **Right panel labeled "With Min":** The same issue (a NIGO) detected, triaged, documented, and resolved. Time-stamped: 47 minutes. A clean audit trail with 4 entries.

**Why this works:** This is the emotional screen. The left panel is every COO's daily life. The right panel is the promise. The time compression (3 days → 47 minutes) is visceral.

The loop restarts. No narration. No music. No animation. Just the product, breathing.

---

## 3. The One-Liner

When someone stops and looks at the screen, Jon waits 3 seconds (let them absorb), then says:

> **"We find the operational problems hiding in your book before they become client problems."**

26 words. Under 5 seconds to deliver. It does four things:
1. **"We find"** — Min is the agent, not the user. It does the work.
2. **"operational problems hiding"** — they're not obvious. Your current tools don't show them. Min does.
3. **"in your book"** — this is for you, not abstractly for "the industry."
4. **"before they become client problems"** — the stakes. Not operational efficiency. Client retention. That's what a COO actually loses sleep over.

If the person nods or leans in: Jon continues to the demo.
If the person says "we're pretty good on operations": Jon says "that's great — how are you monitoring NIGOs across custodians today?" This is a qualifying question disguised as genuine curiosity. If they say "spreadsheet" or "we check manually," they're a prospect. If they say "our custodian flags them," they're less urgent but still reachable.

---

## 4. The Collateral

**On the table:**

### A. Business cards
Jon's card. Standard. One addition on the back: a QR code that goes to a 2-minute product video (not the homepage — a video that shows the triage queue in action with narration).

### B. The One-Pager

**Front side:**

**Headline:** Your ops team manages hundreds of accounts across multiple custodians. How many problems are hiding in the gaps?

**Three columns:**

| **Detect** | **Triage** | **Document** |
|---|---|---|
| Min continuously monitors account data across custodians for NIGOs, drift, fee mismatches, compliance gaps, and missing paperwork. | Every detected issue is scored, prioritized, and routed — no more spreadsheet tracking or "I'll check on that Monday." | Every action taken on every issue creates a timestamped audit trail with source attribution. Your compliance team will thank you. |

**Bottom of front:**

> "The average $300M RIA has 15-25 undetected operational issues at any given time. Min finds them."

**Back side:**

**Who Min is for:**
- RIA firms with $200M+ AUM
- Multi-custodial (Schwab, Fidelity, Pershing, or any combination)
- 3+ person ops team
- Firms that have outgrown spreadsheets but aren't ready for a 12-month enterprise implementation

**What Min is NOT:**
- Not a CRM (works alongside Salesforce, Wealthbox, Redtail, Practifi)
- Not a portfolio management system (works alongside Orion, Black Diamond, Tamarac)
- Not a custodian replacement
- Min is the intelligence layer that sits between your custodians and your team

**Call to action:**

> Schedule a 20-minute demo: min.tech/demo
> Or scan the QR code for a 2-minute video walkthrough

### C. QR Code Stand
Acrylic stand with large QR code (same as business card back). Below it: "See Min in 2 minutes."

No swag. No pens. No candy bowl. The booth communicates seriousness. Swag attracts the wrong traffic.

---

## 5. The Staffing Strategy

**Person 1: Jon (CTPO)** — Demo station. Runs all live demos. Answers all product and technical questions. Jon's job is to demo, qualify, and close for follow-up meetings.

**Person 2: Sarah (RIA Ops Veteran / Advisor)** — Monitor-side greeter. Her roles:
1. **Traffic director:** Engages people who stop at the attract screen. Qualifies with a glance at the badge. Decides whether to bring them to Jon.
2. **Overflow handler:** When Jon is in a demo, Sarah holds the next person's attention with conversation: "What's your firm look like? How are you handling [X] today?" She doesn't demo. She listens and qualifies.
3. **Peer validator:** When a skeptical COO asks "does this actually work at scale?", Sarah can share her own ops experience. This is more credible than anything Jon can say.
4. **Lead capture:** After each interaction, Sarah writes three things on a notepad (not an iPad — a notepad, because it's faster and less awkward): Name, firm, and one sentence about what they cared about. These notes become the follow-up strategy.

**Sarah should NOT:**
- Give demos (that's Jon's job, and consistency matters)
- Make promises about features or timelines
- Engage with obvious competitors (she should recognize them and signal Jon)

# PART 2: EIGHT ATTENDEES IN ONE DAY

---

## ATTENDEE 1: The COO Who's Your Exact Target Buyer

**Profile:** Karen Whitfield. COO, Meridian Wealth Partners. $300M AUM, 4-person ops team, dual-custodial (Schwab + Fidelity). At T3 with a list: Orion, Practifi, Riskalyze, iRebal, Docupace, and "that new compliance thing someone mentioned." Min is not on her list.

### The Approach

Karen is walking briskly toward the Orion booth, which is across the aisle and two booths down. She's looking at her phone, checking her booth-visit list. She glances up to navigate and catches Screen A — "The Wall" — on the attract monitor. Six flagged items. Red dots. Account names.

She doesn't stop walking. But her pace slows. She takes three more steps, then stops and turns back. She stands 8 feet from the monitor and reads the flagged items.

The thing that stopped her: **"NIGO detected — missing beneficiary designation."** She had this exact issue last month. A client's beneficiary designation was missing on a Schwab IRA, and they only caught it because the client died and the estate attorney called. It was a near-miss that kept her up for a week.

### The First 10 Seconds

Karen is reading the screen. Sarah notices her badge — "Karen Whitfield, COO, Meridian Wealth Partners" — and steps toward her.

**Sarah:** "You run ops? Come look at this."

Karen doesn't respond immediately. She's still reading. Then:

**Karen:** "How does it know about the missing beneficiary?"

This is the golden signal. She didn't ask "what is this?" She asked *how.* She's already past "what" — she's at "is this real?"

**Sarah:** (gesturing toward Jon) "Let me introduce you to Jon — he built this. He can show you exactly how."

Sarah walks Karen to the demo station. Jon sees them coming and has already navigated to the account health score view (Screen B equivalent) on his demo laptop.

### The 3-Minute Interaction

**Jon:** "Karen, welcome. I'm Jon. I saw you looking at the triage queue — what caught your eye?"

**Karen:** "The beneficiary flag. We just had a situation with that. How does it know?"

**Jon:** "Min connects directly to your custodial data feeds — Schwab, Fidelity, whoever you use. It reads the account data the same way your team would, but continuously. When a beneficiary designation is missing, or a fee schedule doesn't match your ADV, or an RMD isn't set up — it flags it. Let me show you."

Jon clicks into the Harrison Family Trust account. Health Score: 68/100.

**Karen:** "What's the 68 mean?"

**Jon:** "It's a composite. This account has three open issues: a missing beneficiary on the IRA, a model drift of 3.8%, and a fee that doesn't match what's in the ADV. Each one pulls the score down. When they're resolved, the score goes back up. Your worst accounts float to the top of the queue."

**Karen:** (leaning in) "And these are real? Like, this is actually pulling from custodial data?"

**Jon:** "Every signal has source attribution." (clicks the beneficiary flag — it expands to show: "Source: Schwab Position File, Account #****4472, Beneficiary field: BLANK. Detected: January 14, 2025.") "You can see exactly where the data came from and when we found it."

**Karen:** "We track this stuff in a spreadsheet. Janet runs a report every Monday."

**Jon:** "How long does that take her?"

**Karen:** "Half a day, honestly. And things still slip through."

**Jon:** "Min runs continuously. That Monday report happens every hour, across every account, across every custodian. And when something gets resolved, it creates an audit trail automatically — time-stamped, attributed, ready for compliance."

**Karen:** (the real question) "How many custodians can it connect to?"

This is the qualification question. It tells Jon:
1. She has multiple custodians (confirmed prospect)
2. She's thinking about implementation, not concept (she's past "is this interesting" and at "could this work for us")

**Jon:** "Today we're connected to Schwab, Fidelity, and Pershing. If you're using one of those, we can be live in your environment in about two weeks."

**Karen:** "We're Schwab and Fidelity."

**Jon:** "Perfect. That's our sweet spot."

### The Verdict

**Karen:** "I need to see this with my data. Can we schedule something?"

**Jon:** "Absolutely. Let's do a 20-minute call next week — I'll show you what Min finds in a real account set. We can use sanitized data from your custodians. What day works?"

Karen pulls out her phone. They schedule a Tuesday at 2pm. Jon hands her the one-pager and his card.

**Karen:** "I'm going to show this to my advisor partner. He's somewhere on the floor."

She leaves. Total time: 3 minutes 40 seconds.

### The Debrief

**What Jon learned:**
- The beneficiary flag is the single most powerful hook. It's specific, terrifying (someone could die and the designation is missing), and every COO has had a near-miss with it.
- Karen didn't ask about dashboards, reporting, or integrations. She asked about data sources and accuracy. **Trust is the sale, not features.**
- The phrase "how does it know?" is the ideal first question. It means the product communicated the *what* — the person is already asking about the *how.* The attract screen worked.
- Karen's "spreadsheet" admission is the universal pain point. "Janet's Monday report" is the status quo Min replaces. Use this phrase in future demos: "How long does your Monday report take?"

**What should change:** Nothing. This is the golden path. Replicate it.

---

## ATTENDEE 2: The Advisor Who Doesn't Know He Needs This

**Profile:** David Chen. Senior Advisor, Greenleaf Financial Group. $150M personal book. Age 54. Uses Salesforce but doesn't really understand it — his assistant Lauren handles everything. He's at T3 because his firm paid for the trip and he wanted to see the Salesforce Financial Services Cloud demo. He's walking past Min's booth eating a conference cookie.

### The Approach

David slows down because Screen C — the before/after split — is on the monitor. The "Before Min" panel looks like his inbox: emails, spreadsheets, a custodian portal screenshot. He recognizes the chaos.

**Sarah:** (noticing his "Advisor" badge) "Have you seen what your ops team deals with every day?"

**David:** (chuckling) "I try not to."

**Sarah:** "Fair enough. But this might be interesting — come take a look."

### The First 10 Seconds

David walks to the monitor. He's reading the before/after but not deeply. He's eating his cookie.

**Jon:** (from the demo station, casual) "That left panel look familiar?"

**David:** "Unfortunately, yeah. That's Lauren's desk."

### The 3-Minute Interaction

**Jon:** "Who's Lauren?"

**David:** "My ops person. She manages all my accounts — paperwork, transfers, the whole thing."

**Jon:** "How many accounts does she manage?"

**David:** "Maybe 200? Between mine and another advisor's book."

**Jon:** "If something's wrong with one of those accounts — a missing form, a fee error, a compliance issue — how does she find out?"

**David:** "She checks. Or the custodian tells us. Or the client calls and complains." (laughs)

**Jon:** "What if she could see all 200 accounts at once and know instantly which ones have problems?"

Jon turns the demo laptop toward David. The triage queue is on screen — 8 flagged items.

**David:** "So it's like... a dashboard?"

**Jon:** "Not exactly. Dashboards show you what you ask to see. This finds problems you didn't know to look for. See this one? 'Fee schedule mismatch — $347.' That means the client is being charged differently than what's in your ADV. Lauren might not catch that for months. Min caught it in hours."

**David:** (suddenly serious) "That's a compliance issue."

**Jon:** "Exactly."

**David:** "And it does this automatically? Lauren doesn't have to run anything?"

**Jon:** "It runs continuously. Connects directly to your custodian data."

**David:** (long pause) "Lauren needs to see this."

This is the champion moment. David can't buy Min. He doesn't know what an ADV is in detail. But he just went from "I try not to think about ops" to "Lauren needs to see this" in under two minutes.

**Jon:** "I'd love to show Lauren. Here's what I'd suggest — take this one-pager and my card. Tell Lauren to look at it and if it resonates, have her reach out and we'll do a 20-minute walkthrough with her."

**David:** "Can I take two? I'll give one to my COO too."

### The Verdict

David takes two one-pagers and Jon's card. He doesn't schedule a call — he's not the decision-maker and he knows it. But he says: "I'm going to tell Lauren this afternoon."

Total time: 2 minutes 20 seconds.

### The Debrief

**What Jon learned:**
- **The fee mismatch is the advisor hook.** Advisors don't care about NIGOs or beneficiary designations — that's ops territory. But fee mismatches between what clients pay and what the ADV says? That's a compliance issue that can end a career. David went from casual to serious in one second.
- **"Lauren needs to see this" is the internal champion conversion.** The demo needs a moment designed specifically for this — a finding so clearly operational-yet-dangerous that an advisor feels compelled to tell their ops person.
- **Avoid ops vocabulary with advisors.** Jon never said "NIGO," "triage," or "orchestration." He said "problems," "finds," and "automatically." The demo adapted correctly.
- **The two-pager request is a strong signal.** When someone takes extras, they're planning to evangelize.

**What should change:** Add a fee mismatch example to the attract screen rotation. It bridges the advisor-to-ops gap.

---

## ATTENDEE 3: The Tire-Kicker Who Wastes 8 Minutes

**Profile:** Brad Simmons. Independent advisor, Simmons Financial Planning. $40M AUM. Solo practice with one part-time assistant. He's at T3 on a free expo pass (didn't pay for the full conference). He visits every booth. He has a tote bag from Riskalyze full of vendor swag.

### The Approach

Brad walks directly into the booth because the front-right side is open and there's no table blocking entry. He doesn't look at the monitor. He looks at Jon.

**Brad:** "Hey! What do you guys do?"

### The First 10 Seconds

**Jon:** "We find the operational problems hiding in your book before they become client problems."

**Brad:** "Oh cool, like compliance stuff?"

**Jon:** "Operations more broadly — NIGOs, fee mismatches, missing paperwork, model drift. How big is your practice?"

This is Jon's qualifying question, delivered early. Critical.

**Brad:** "About 40 million. Growing fast though — should be at 60 by year end."

Jon now knows: Brad is below the $200M target. A solo advisor with $40M doesn't have an "ops team." He IS his ops team. Min's value proposition — monitoring hundreds of accounts across a multi-person ops team — doesn't apply.

### The 3-Minute (Actually 8-Minute) Interaction

**Jon should say:** "That's great growth. Honestly, Min is really designed for larger firms — teams with dedicated ops staff managing 500+ accounts. At your stage, you probably have a pretty good handle on your book personally."

**What Jon actually says:** "Let me show you what we do."

This is the mistake. Jon is in "booth mode" and defaults to demoing for anyone who's interested. He opens the triage queue.

**Brad:** "Oh that's cool. Can it do financial planning too?"

**Jon:** "No, it's focused on operations — account monitoring and issue detection."

**Brad:** "What about portfolio rebalancing?"

**Jon:** "No, it works alongside your rebalancing tool. It detects when drift happens, but the rebalancing happens in your existing system."

**Brad:** "What systems does it integrate with? I use Wealthscape."

**Jon:** "We connect to Schwab, Fidelity, and Pershing custodial feeds."

**Brad:** "I'm at LPL. Are you going to support LPL?"

**Jon:** "It's on our roadmap but not available today."

**Brad:** "What about Redtail? I use Redtail for CRM."

**Jon:** "Min is custodian-connected — it doesn't integrate with CRMs directly yet, though it's planned."

**Brad:** "Hmm. What does it cost?"

**Jon:** "We're in early access right now — pricing depends on firm size and custodian setup."

**Brad:** "Can I get a free trial?"

**Jon:** "We're not doing self-service trials yet — we do guided implementations."

**Brad:** "You should do a free trial. Everyone does free trials now. I'm also looking at Kitces, AdvicePay, RightCapital, Holistiplan, FP Alpha, Riskalyze — they all have free trials."

**Jon:** "Those are great products but they solve different problems. Min is specifically—"

**Brad:** "I know, I know. But I'm just saying, for adoption, you need a free trial. Let me give you my card..."

Brad is now reaching into his tote bag. This has been going on for 6 minutes. During that time:
- A woman in a navy blazer (who turned out to be the COO of a $600M firm) slowed at the attract screen, saw Jon was occupied, and kept walking.
- A man who looked like he might be a tech consultant glanced at the signage, saw the booth was busy, and moved on.

Sarah tried to engage the woman in the navy blazer, but without Jon available for a demo, the interaction fizzled after 30 seconds: "He's with someone right now — can I take your card and have Jon reach out?" The woman said "I'll come back" and didn't.

**Jon:** (finally) "Brad, I appreciate your time. Here's my card and a one-pager — take a look and if your practice grows to where you're bringing on a dedicated ops person, reach out."

**Brad:** "Definitely! This is really cool. You should also add financial planning. And a free trial."

Brad leaves. Total time: 8 minutes 15 seconds. Two real prospects lost.

### The Verdict

Brad takes a one-pager, a business card, and picks up two cookies from the table next-door's booth. He will not become a customer. He will add Jon's email to a list of 40 vendor contacts from T3 and never follow up.

### The Debrief

**What Jon learned:**

The hardest lesson of the day. Two qualified prospects lost because Jon couldn't disengage from an unqualified one.

**Immediate fixes:**

1. **Qualify in the first 15 seconds.** Jon's "how big is your practice?" question worked — he got the answer ($40M). But he didn't ACT on it. He should have said: "At $40M, you're probably managing things yourself, which is great. Min is really built for the 200M-plus range where the ops complexity gets overwhelming. But take a one-pager — when you scale up, we'd love to talk." Graceful, honest, 20 seconds.

2. **The signage should pre-qualify.** "Your ops team is drowning" already does some work — a solo advisor doesn't have an "ops team." But consider adding to the one-pager qualification section: bold the $200M+ requirement.

3. **Sarah's role expands.** When Jon is occupied, Sarah must be able to hold a qualified prospect for 3-5 minutes. Script for Sarah: "Jon's finishing up — let me show you what's on screen while we wait. What does your ops team look like today?" Sarah doesn't demo, but she can have a discovery conversation and take a card.

4. **The "I'll come back" problem.** Nobody comes back. Sarah should get the person's card AND schedule a specific time: "Jon has a break at 2:30 — can you come back then?" Or: "Can I get your card and have Jon call you tonight?" Specificity beats politeness.

5. **Time limit rule.** Jon sets a mental timer: 3 minutes maximum for any interaction. At 3 minutes, if the person isn't qualified, gracefully exit. "This has been great — let me give you our one-pager so you can explore more, and I'll grab the next person."

## ATTENDEE 4: The Practifi Sales Rep Doing Competitive Reconnaissance

**Profile:** Megan Torres. Regional Sales Director, Practifi. She's been at Practifi for 3 years. Previously worked at a $400M RIA. She knows the ops world from the practitioner side. She's smart, she's subtle, and her badge is flipped backward — you can't read her name or company.

### The Approach

Megan walks slowly past the booth, looking at the attract screen with an analytical gaze. She's not browsing — she's studying. She reads the signage: "Your ops team is drowning. Min sees why." She pulls out her phone and takes a photo of the backdrop.

She walks to the demo station.

**Megan:** "This is interesting. Can you tell me more?"

She doesn't offer her name. Her badge is flipped. Jon doesn't notice.

### The First 10 Seconds

**Jon:** "Sure — we find the operational problems hiding in your book before they become client problems. Are you in operations?"

**Megan:** "I used to be. I ran ops at a mid-sized firm for five years. Now I'm on the technology side."

This is carefully truthful and deliberately vague. "Technology side" could mean anything — vendor, consultant, internal IT.

**Jon:** "Great, so you know the pain. Let me show you."

### The 3-Minute Interaction

Jon opens the triage queue. Megan watches carefully.

**Megan:** "How does this compare to what you can do in a CRM? Practifi has some operations tracking built in."

This is her first probe. She's mapping Min against Practifi's Action Plans and workflow features.

**Jon:** "Good question. CRMs are great at tracking tasks your team creates — 'follow up with client,' 'submit form.' Min does something different. It detects problems your team hasn't found yet. The CRM tracks what you know about. Min finds what you don't know about."

**Megan:** (mentally noting: *positioning against CRM workflows — "finds what you don't know about" — this is the detection angle*)

"So it's more of a monitoring tool?"

**Jon:** "Monitoring plus intelligence. It doesn't just detect — it scores, prioritizes, and creates audit trails. And it writes back to your systems when issues are resolved."

**Megan:** "Write-back to which systems?"

**Jon:** "Custodian platforms primarily. We can update account records, submit forms, trigger workflows."

**Megan:** (probing for technical depth) "That's impressive. What's the data architecture? Is it pulling from custodian APIs or file feeds?"

**Jon:** "Both. We use custodial data feeds for the core account data — position files, transaction files — and API connections where available for real-time signals."

**Megan:** "How long has this been in production?"

This is the vaporware probe. She wants to know if it's real.

**Jon:** "We've been in development for 18 months and in pilot with select firms for the last 6 months."

**Megan:** "How many firms are using it?"

**Jon:** "We're in early access with a small cohort — I can't share specific numbers, but the feedback has been strong enough that we're here at T3."

**Megan:** (internally: *small user base — can attack on maturity and scale*)

"What about reporting? Can it generate compliance reports?"

**Jon:** "Every action creates a timestamped audit trail with source attribution. You can pull compliance-ready documentation for any account, any issue, any time period."

**Megan:** "Can it do that across multiple custodians in a single view?"

**Jon:** "That's actually our core strength. Multi-custodial is where the complexity explodes, and that's where Min excels."

**Megan:** (this is the one thing she can't attack — Practifi doesn't do multi-custodial ops monitoring)

"This is really impressive. Do you have a card?"

### The Verdict

Megan takes a card and a one-pager. She smiles warmly, thanks Jon, and walks directly to a quiet corner where she opens her phone and starts typing notes.

Total time: 3 minutes 30 seconds.

### What Megan Learned (The Competitive Intelligence)

**Attacks she'll prepare:**

1. **"Min is early stage and unproven."** Small user base, 18 months old, in "pilot." She'll tell prospects: "Do you want to bet your operations on a startup that's been in pilot for 6 months with a handful of firms?"

2. **"Min is monitoring, not workflow."** She'll position Practifi as the action platform: "Min tells you what's wrong. Practifi helps you fix it, track it, and manage the client relationship around it. Which would you rather have — a list of problems, or a system that solves them?"

3. **"No CRM integration."** Jon mentioned write-back to custodians, not CRMs. She'll hammer: "Min can't even talk to your CRM. Your team will be toggling between systems."

**What she CAN'T attack:**

1. **Multi-custodial detection.** Practifi doesn't do this. It can track tasks across custodians, but it can't automatically detect operational issues by reading custodial data feeds. This is Min's moat and Megan knows it.

2. **Source attribution / provenance.** Practifi doesn't show you where data came from at the field level. Min's "Source: Schwab Position File, Account #****4472" is a trust mechanism that Practifi can't replicate without becoming a data platform.

3. **The health score concept.** Practifi shows you task completion. Min shows you account health. These are fundamentally different views. Health score implies continuous monitoring; task completion implies human-initiated workflows.

### The Debrief

**What Jon should have done differently:**

1. **Notice the flipped badge.** Anyone who flips their badge is either a competitor or press. Jon should have a standard response: "Happy to give you an overview — can I see your badge so I know how to frame this?" This isn't aggressive — it's practical. If she refuses, Jon keeps the demo high-level and avoids revealing technical architecture.

2. **Don't reveal the data architecture.** "File feeds and APIs" gives a competitor a roadmap. Better answer: "We have deep integrations with the major custodians — I'm happy to get into architecture details on a follow-up call." This is honest and professional without being naively transparent.

3. **Don't reveal user count.** "Small cohort" is blood in the water. Better: "We're in production with firms across the $200M to $2B range. I can share case studies on a follow-up call."

4. **Protect the write-back capability.** This is a technical differentiator. Don't reveal it to unknown visitors. Better to show the detection and audit trail — keep write-back for qualified prospects in private demos.

**Competitive defense strategy for all booth demos:**
- Lead with detection and health scores (Practifi can't replicate)
- Show source attribution early (unique capability)
- Don't reveal architecture, data pipelines, or write-back to anyone whose badge you can't read
- If asked "how does this compare to [competitor]?", respond: "We're complementary. Min handles the detection layer that sits between your custodians and your existing tools — including your CRM."

## ATTENDEE 5: The Compliance Officer Who's Been Burned

**Profile:** Diana Marchetti. Chief Compliance Officer, Pinnacle Advisory Group. $2B AUM, 40 employees, SEC-registered. They just went through a 3-week SEC examination that resulted in two deficiency findings: inadequate supervision of account transfers and insufficient documentation of fee calculations. Diana is at T3 specifically to find technology that prevents this from happening again.

### The Approach

Diana sees the signage: "Your ops team is drowning. Min sees why." She stops not because of "drowning" but because of "sees." She interprets it through a compliance lens: *can it see what the SEC sees?*

She walks directly to the demo station. No small talk.

**Diana:** "What does the audit trail look like?"

### The First 10 Seconds

This is not a normal booth interaction. Diana skipped the pleasantries and went straight to her core question. Jon needs to match her energy.

**Jon:** "Let me show you." (He clicks into an account, clicks on a resolved issue — a fee mismatch that was detected, investigated, and corrected. The audit trail shows:)

- Jan 14, 2:14pm — Issue detected. Fee schedule mismatch: client charged 0.95%, ADV states 0.85%. Source: Schwab billing file.
- Jan 14, 2:14pm — Issue categorized: Fee/Billing. Severity: High. Assigned to: Ops Queue.
- Jan 15, 9:22am — Reviewed by: Janet Morrison. Action: Confirmed mismatch. Schwab fee schedule updated.
- Jan 15, 10:47am — Write-back confirmed. Schwab billing adjusted. Client refund of $347 initiated.
- Jan 15, 10:47am — Issue resolved. Time to resolution: 20h 33m.

Diana leans in and reads every line.

### The 3-Minute Interaction

**Diana:** "Who writes these entries? Your system or the user?"

**Jon:** "Both. The detection and categorization are automatic — Min writes those. The review and action entries are logged when the ops person takes action in Min. Everything is timestamped and attributed."

**Diana:** "Can I export this?"

**Jon:** "Yes — by account, by issue type, by date range, or by the person who handled it."

**Diana:** "Here's my question." (This is the hardest compliance question Jon will face.)

**"If the SEC asks me to demonstrate that we have a reasonable supervisory system for detecting and correcting billing errors across all client accounts — can Min produce that documentation?"**

This is not a feature question. This is a legal question. The SEC's Rule 206(4)-7 requires advisors to have policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations. The key word is "reasonably designed." Diana doesn't need Min to be perfect. She needs it to be documentable.

**Jon:** "Let me answer that carefully. Min creates a continuous, timestamped record of every operational issue it detects, every action taken on that issue, and the resolution. It includes the data source, the person who handled it, and the timeline. That's the raw documentation. Whether it satisfies a specific examiner's definition of 'reasonable supervision' depends on how your compliance policies reference the system. But I can tell you this: the firms using Min today have more documentation of their supervisory activities than any firm I've seen — because the documentation is automatic, not retroactive."

**Diana:** (nodding slowly) "That's the right answer. Most vendors say 'yes, we solve compliance.' You said 'here's what we produce, you decide how it fits your program.' That's honest."

**Jon:** "Can I ask — you mentioned the audit trail first. Did you have a recent examination?"

**Diana:** "Two deficiency findings. Fee supervision and transfer documentation. I need a system that makes those findings impossible next time."

**Jon:** "Min would have caught both of those. Fee mismatches are detected automatically from custodial billing files. And every account transfer creates a signal — if a transfer is initiated without proper documentation, it's flagged before it completes."

**Diana:** "I want to see this with our data. Not demo data."

### The Verdict

**Jon:** "Absolutely. Let's schedule a call — I'll walk you through what Min finds in your actual custodial feeds. We can do it with sanitized data if you prefer, or live. What works for you?"

Diana pulls out her phone and schedules a 30-minute call for next Wednesday. She takes two one-pagers — one for herself, one for her CEO.

**Diana:** "If this does what you're showing me, we'll move fast."

Total time: 4 minutes 10 seconds. (She would have stayed longer but had another booth to visit.)

### The Debrief

**What Jon learned:**

- **Compliance is a viable — maybe dominant — sales angle.** Diana didn't care about dashboards, health scores, or operational efficiency. She cared about one thing: documentation that satisfies examiners. And Min produces it automatically.

- **The audit trail is the product for compliance buyers.** Not the triage queue. Not the health score. The timestamped, attributed, exportable audit trail. This buyer persona looks at Min and sees "evidence generator."

- **"Reasonable supervision" is the magic phrase.** SEC examiners evaluate whether firms have "reasonably designed" supervisory systems. Min is, by its nature, a supervisory system that documents its own operation. This is the compliance pitch: "Min is a continuous supervisory system with built-in documentation."

- **CCOs buy differently.** Diana didn't say "interesting" or "let me think about it." She said "I want to see this with our data." Compliance officers have urgency that COOs sometimes lack — they've been burned, and the burn is recent.

- **The signage works for compliance too.** "Min sees why" attracted Diana because she interpreted "sees" as "monitors/detects." The word is doing double duty: ops people read it as insight, compliance people read it as surveillance. Both are correct.

**What should change:**
- Add a compliance-specific example to the attract screen rotation: a fee supervision issue with full audit trail visible.
- Create a compliance-focused version of the one-pager that leads with "Continuous supervisory documentation" instead of "Operations intelligence."
- Consider having both versions on the table, or a double-sided one-pager with ops on front and compliance on back.

## ATTENDEE 6: The Tech Consultant / Influencer

**Profile:** Marcus Webb. Founder, RIA TechStack Advisors. Manages technology recommendations for 200+ RIA firms. He's been at T3 for two days. He's visited 40 booths. He's carrying 35 business cards and his feet hurt. He gives every new vendor exactly 90 seconds.

### The Approach

Marcus is doing a systematic sweep of the "Startup Row" section of the expo floor. He's visiting every booth in order. Min is the 41st booth he's seen today. He walks in because he walks into every booth.

**Marcus:** "New product?"

**Jon:** "Min. Operations intelligence for RIAs. We find the problems hiding in your book before they become client problems."

Marcus checks his watch. 90 seconds starts now.

### The 90-Second Interaction

**Marcus:** "Give me the 30-second version. What do you do that Practifi and Orion don't?"

This is the most efficient question anyone has asked all day. Marcus is filtering. He's seen every CRM, every portfolio management system, every planning tool. He needs to know: is this a new category or a feature that belongs inside an existing product?

**Jon:** "We sit between the custodians and the CRM. Practifi tracks workflows your team creates. Orion manages portfolios. Neither one reads your custodial data feeds and tells you 'this account has a missing beneficiary, this fee is wrong, this RMD isn't set up.' We do. Continuously. Across every custodian."

Marcus's eyebrows move. 0.5mm. That's the equivalent of a standing ovation from a tech consultant who's seen 40 products today.

**Marcus:** "So you're an anomaly detection layer on custodial data."

**Jon:** "That's exactly right. With prioritization, audit trails, and write-back."

**Marcus:** "Who's using it?"

**Jon:** "We're in early access with firms in the $200M to $2B range, dual- and tri-custodial."

**Marcus:** "What's the implementation look like?"

**Jon:** "Two weeks. We connect to your custodial data feeds — no middleware, no IT project. The firm starts seeing signals within 48 hours of connection."

**Marcus:** "Interesting." (He pulls a card from his jacket pocket — not the tote bag, the jacket pocket. The jacket pocket cards are for vendors he might actually recommend.) "Send me a one-pager and a technical overview. I want to understand the data architecture."

**Jon:** "Absolutely." (Hands him the one-pager and his card.) "Can I get your card too? I'll send the technical doc tomorrow."

**Marcus:** "Sure. One more question — what happens when you find something? Is it just a flag, or does it create workflow?"

**Jon:** "Today it's detection, prioritization, and documentation. We create the audit trail. Workflow integration — pushing tasks into Practifi, Salesforce, Wealthbox — is in development."

**Marcus:** (nodding) "That's the right answer. Don't try to be the CRM. Be the intelligence layer." He takes the card, the one-pager, and leaves.

Total time: 87 seconds.

### The Verdict

Marcus gave Jon a business card from his jacket pocket. This is a strong signal. He asked for a technical overview, which means he's going to evaluate Min for potential inclusion in his recommendation framework. If Min passes his technical evaluation, Marcus will mention it to every firm he advises that has multi-custodial complexity.

### The Debrief

**What Jon learned:**

- **"Anomaly detection layer on custodial data" is how a sophisticated buyer describes Min.** This is the technical positioning that resonates with influencers and consultants. It's precise, category-creating, and immediately differentiating. Consider using this language (or a version of it) in technical materials.

- **"What happens when you find something?" is the second most important question after "how does it know?"** Marcus was testing whether Min tries to be everything (detection + workflow + CRM) or stays focused (detection + documentation). He approved of the focused answer. The "don't try to be the CRM" advice from a consultant who advises 200 firms is gold.

- **90 seconds is enough if the positioning is sharp.** Jon got Marcus from "new product?" to "send me a technical overview" in under 90 seconds because the one-liner worked, the competitive differentiation was clear ("between custodians and CRM"), and the implementation story was simple ("two weeks, no IT project").

- **"Two weeks, no middleware, no IT project" is a killer line.** RIA technology implementations are notorious nightmares. The fact that Min can go live in two weeks without IT involvement is a differentiator that deserves more prominence.

**What should change:**
- Create a "Technical Overview" document — separate from the one-pager — designed for tech consultants and evaluators. Architecture diagram, data flow, integration model, security posture.
- Add the "two weeks to live" line to the one-pager.
- Consider the phrase "anomaly detection layer" in technical materials (not marketing — it's too cold for buyers, but perfect for evaluators).

## ATTENDEE 7: The CEO Who's About to Sell His Firm

**Profile:** Richard Hale. Founder and CEO, Hale Capital Group. $500M AUM, 25 employees. He's in quiet conversations with two PE-backed aggregators about acquisition. He's at T3 not to buy technology but to understand it — he wants to know what acquirers will value in his tech stack and what gaps they'll find.

### The Approach

Richard walks the floor slowly, observing more than engaging. He stops at Min's booth because the signage — "Your ops team is drowning" — made him think about how an acquirer would evaluate his operations.

**Richard:** (to Sarah) "Interesting product. Who's it for?"

**Sarah:** "Firms with $200M or more in assets who want to get ahead of operational problems before they hit. Are you on the ops side?"

**Richard:** "I'm the CEO. We're $500M."

Sarah brings him to Jon.

### The 3-Minute Interaction

**Jon:** "Richard, welcome. What brought you over?"

**Richard:** "Curiosity. I'm trying to understand where the market's going with operations technology. We've built a good ops team but I want to know what's out there."

This is a sophisticated non-answer. He's not going to say "I'm selling my firm." But Jon should hear the signal: "where the market's going" is due diligence language, not buying language.

**Jon:** "Happy to give you the overview." (Standard triage queue demo — 60 seconds.)

**Richard:** (after watching) "So this essentially creates a quality score for operations across the whole firm?"

**Jon:** "Exactly. Every account gets a health score. The aggregate tells you the operational health of the entire practice."

**Richard:** (here it comes) "If you were doing due diligence on a firm — say, evaluating whether to acquire them or merge with them — could you use Min to assess their operational quality?"

This is the M&A question. Richard just revealed his hand. He's not asking for himself — he's asking how a buyer would use Min.

**Jon:** (recognizing the significance) "That's a great question. Yes — and we've actually thought about this. If you connect Min to a firm's custodial feeds, within 48 hours you'd have a complete operational health picture: how many accounts have issues, what kinds of issues, how long they've been there, and whether they're being addressed. For a buyer, that's incredibly valuable — it's like an X-ray of the firm's operational quality."

**Richard:** "And conversely — if a firm already has Min running, and they can show a buyer that their health scores are consistently high and issues are resolved within 24 hours..."

**Jon:** "...then they're demonstrating operational maturity that most firms can't prove. You'd be handing an acquirer documented evidence that your operations are clean."

**Richard:** (pause) "That's a very interesting value proposition."

**Jon:** "It's actually one of the most compelling use cases we've seen. Firms that can prove operational quality command better multiples. The problem is that most firms can't prove it — they just claim it."

**Richard:** "What would it take to get this running at my firm?"

**Jon:** "Two weeks to connect your custodians. Within a month, you'd have a baseline health score for every account and a documented track record of issue detection and resolution."

**Richard:** "I might want to move on this quickly."

### The Verdict

Richard gives Jon his card and asks Jon to call him Monday. Not Tuesday, not "next week." Monday. He doesn't explain why the urgency, but Jon can infer: the acquisition timeline is in motion and Richard wants Min's data as part of his firm's value proposition to buyers.

Total time: 3 minutes 50 seconds.

### The Debrief

**What Jon learned:**

- **The M&A angle is real and urgent.** RIA acquisitions are at an all-time high. PE-backed aggregators are buying firms at 8-12x revenue multiples. The difference between an 8x and a 12x multiple can be millions of dollars. If Min can demonstrate that a firm's operations are clean, documented, and monitored — that's worth more than the annual subscription cost in a single deal.

- **"Prove it" is the M&A value.** Richard's insight: every firm claims clean operations. No firm can prove it. Min provides the proof. This is a positioning angle that deserves its own marketing track: "Min doesn't just improve your operations. It proves they're excellent."

- **The M&A buyer is a different persona.** Richard isn't buying Min to save his ops team 10 hours a week. He's buying Min to add $500K-$1M to his firm's acquisition value. The ROI calculation is completely different.

- **Language for this use case:**
  - "Operational due diligence in 48 hours"
  - "Documented operational maturity"
  - "Prove, don't claim"
  - "The X-ray for operational quality"
  - "Acquirers pay premiums for firms that can prove what others only promise"

**What should change:**
- Create an M&A-focused section on the website (not prominent, but findable by this persona).
- Consider a "Firm Health Report" exportable PDF — a one-page operational health summary that a CEO could include in an acquisition data room.
- Add "Due diligence ready" as a bullet point on the one-pager.

## ATTENDEE 8: The Person Who's Already Seen the LinkedIn Post

**Profile:** Priya Sharma. COO, Clearwater Wealth Advisors. $400M AUM, 6-person ops team, tri-custodial (Schwab, Fidelity, Pershing). She saw Jon's LinkedIn post about Min three weeks ago and saved it. She showed it to her team. Two people on her team said "that sounds like exactly what we need." She came to T3 specifically to see Min in person.

### The Approach

Priya walks directly to the booth. She doesn't need the signage. She doesn't look at the attract screen. She looks for Jon.

**Priya:** "Jon? I'm Priya Sharma. I've been following Min on LinkedIn."

### The First 10 Seconds

This is the warmest intro Jon will get all day. Priya is pre-sold on the concept. But she's at the booth to answer one question: **is it real?**

The LinkedIn post showed polished screenshots. Conference booths show polished demos. Priya has been burned by vaporware before — a beautiful demo that turned out to be a Figma prototype. She's looking for rough edges, because rough edges prove it's real.

**Jon:** "Priya, great to meet you in person. You're tri-custodial, right? Schwab, Fidelity, and Pershing?"

**Priya:** (surprised) "You remember from my comment on the post?"

**Jon:** "I read every comment. Your situation is exactly what we built Min for."

### The 3-Minute Interaction

**Jon:** "What do you want to see? I can walk you through the standard demo or I can show you whatever's most relevant to your team."

**Priya:** "Show me the messiest part. The part that doesn't work perfectly yet."

This is a sophisticated request. She's testing for honesty, not features.

**Jon:** "Fair enough. Here's something we're still working on." (He navigates to a view showing signal detection across three custodians.) "See these Pershing accounts? Our Pershing integration is newer than Schwab and Fidelity. The detection latency is about 4 hours for Pershing versus near-real-time for Schwab. We're working on closing that gap, but it's not there yet."

**Priya:** (nodding) "That's fine. I expected Pershing would be behind — it's always behind on everything. What about false positives?"

**Jon:** "We see about a 5-8% false positive rate on fee mismatch detection. It's usually because of billing timing — a fee that looks mismatched because the ADV was updated but the custodian hasn't processed the change yet. We're building a suppression layer so known timing issues don't generate noise."

**Priya:** "That's the kind of thing that would drive my team crazy if it's too noisy."

**Jon:** "Agreed. That's why we have severity scoring — high-severity signals are almost never false positives. The noise is in the low-severity tier, and we're actively reducing it."

**Priya:** "OK. Now show me the thing from the LinkedIn post — the account health score with the drilldown."

Jon shows her the health score view. She watches carefully.

**Priya:** "It looks the same as the post. That's good."

**The gap she identifies:** "In the LinkedIn post, you showed what looked like a resolution workflow — like, the ops person could click 'resolve' and it would update the custodian. Is that live?"

**Jon:** "The write-back to custodians is functional for Schwab. Fidelity write-back is in beta. Pershing isn't available yet."

**Priya:** "So for my firm, it's really Schwab write-back today, with the other two as detect-and-document."

**Jon:** "That's accurate. The detection and audit trail work across all three. The write-back is Schwab-first."

**Priya:** "When do you expect Fidelity and Pershing write-back?"

**Jon:** "Fidelity in Q2, Pershing in Q3. I won't promise dates I can't keep."

**Priya:** "I appreciate that." (She pauses.) "Here's what I need. I need to bring this back to my team and show them it's real. Can we do a 45-minute demo next week with my three senior ops people on the call?"

**Jon:** "Absolutely. Can we do Wednesday or Thursday?"

**Priya:** "Thursday at 10am Eastern."

**Jon:** "Done. I'll send a calendar invite today. And I'll prepare a view that shows what Min would detect in a tri-custodial setup like yours."

**Priya:** "One more thing — the LinkedIn post said something about 'catching 15-25 issues the average firm doesn't know about.' Is that real?"

**Jon:** "It's based on our pilot data. Every firm we've connected has had issues they didn't know about. The range depends on firm size and custodial complexity. A firm your size — $400M, three custodians — I'd expect the higher end of that range."

**Priya:** "If you find 20 issues we didn't know about in our data, we'll sign that week."

### The Verdict

Priya has a 45-minute demo scheduled for Thursday with her ops team. She took two one-pagers and Jon's card. She's the most qualified, most motivated prospect of the day.

**The gap between marketing and product:** Priya identified one real gap — write-back is Schwab-only in production, but the LinkedIn post implied it worked across custodians. Jon handled it with honesty ("that's accurate... I won't promise dates I can't keep"), which actually strengthened trust. But the gap should be addressed in future LinkedIn content: be explicit about which custodians have which capabilities.

Total time: 4 minutes 30 seconds.

### The Debrief

**What Jon learned:**

- **"Show me the messiest part" is the best test of a demo.** Priya's request forced Jon to be honest, which made him more credible. Counter-intuitively, showing the Pershing latency issue and the false positive rate made Priya MORE interested, not less. Sophisticated buyers expect imperfection — they distrust perfection.

- **LinkedIn-to-booth pipeline works.** Priya came specifically because of a LinkedIn post. She was pre-qualified, pre-motivated, and pre-sold on the concept. The booth just had to confirm reality. This suggests that the LinkedIn content strategy is more important than the booth itself — the booth is the conversion point, but LinkedIn is the awareness engine.

- **"If you find 20 issues, we'll sign that week."** This is the single most valuable thing anyone said all day. It means: the product sells itself if it works. The demo doesn't need to be flashy. It needs to find real problems. The pilot-with-your-data approach is the sales strategy.

- **Custodian parity matters.** Priya's firm uses three custodians. If write-back only works for one, the product feels incomplete for her use case — even if detection works for all three. Custodian parity should be communicated clearly: "detection across all three, write-back expanding from Schwab outward."

**What should change:**
- LinkedIn content should explicitly state custodian coverage for each capability tier (detect, prioritize, resolve). Don't let marketing outpace the product.
- The "find issues in your data" pilot should be the standard sales motion, not the demo. Offer every qualified prospect: "Let us connect to your data for a week. We'll show you what we find. No commitment."
- Priya's "if you find 20 issues, we'll sign" is the ultimate testimonial line. If she converts, get permission to use a version of that quote.

# PART 3: THE 3-MINUTE DEMO SCRIPT

Based on the 8 interactions, here is the optimized click-by-click demo.

---

## Seconds 0-10: The Hook

**Screen:** The triage queue ("The Wall") — 6-8 flagged items across multiple accounts, severity dots visible.

**Jon says:** "You're looking at every operational problem hiding in this firm's book right now."

**Goal:** They decide to stay. The word "hiding" does the work — it implies their firm has these problems too and they don't know about them.

**Click:** None. Let them absorb the screen.

---

## Seconds 10-40: The Problem

**Screen:** Jon points to specific items in the queue.

**Jon says:** "See this one? Missing beneficiary designation on a Schwab IRA. This one? Fee mismatch — client's being charged 10 basis points more than the ADV says. This one? RMD not scheduled for 2025. Every one of these was detected automatically from custodial data. No one on the ops team ran a report. No one checked a spreadsheet. Min found them."

**Click:** Jon points to each item as he mentions it but doesn't click yet.

**Goal:** Recognition. The attendee thinks: "We have those exact problems. We track them in spreadsheets. Some of them we probably don't even catch."

---

## Seconds 40-90: The First Lightbulb

**Screen:** Jon clicks into the Harrison Family Trust account. The account health score appears: **68/100**. Three active signals listed beneath.

**Jon says:** "Every account gets a health score. 68 means three open issues. This account has been at 68 for four days — nobody on the team knew. Min knew."

**Click:** Jon clicks the beneficiary flag. It expands to show:
> Source: Schwab Position File, Account #****4472, Beneficiary field: BLANK. Detected: January 14, 2025.

**Jon says:** "And you can see exactly where the data came from. That's not a guess — that's the Schwab position file, read automatically."

**Goal:** Surprise. "Wait, it reads the custodial data feeds automatically?" This is the moment they lean in.

---

## Seconds 90-120: The Second Lightbulb

**Screen:** Jon clicks on the fee mismatch signal. It expands to show:
> Client charged: 0.95%. ADV states: 0.85%. Difference: $347/year. Source: Schwab billing file + ADV filing.

**Jon says:** "This is a different kind of problem — a compliance issue. The client's being overcharged relative to the ADV. This isn't a paperwork error. This is the kind of thing that shows up in an SEC examination. Min caught it the day the billing file came through."

**Click:** Jon scrolls to show the audit trail for this issue:
> Detected Jan 14. Reviewed by ops Jan 15. Fee corrected Jan 15. Refund initiated. Documented.

**Jon says:** "And when it's resolved, the entire trail is documented — who found it, when, who fixed it, how. That's your compliance record, generated automatically."

**Goal:** "This is a real product." The first lightbulb (detection) could be a trick. The second lightbulb (compliance + audit trail) proves it's a system, not a demo.

---

## Seconds 120-150: The Proof

**Screen:** Jon zooms out to the firm-level view showing all accounts. Sorts by health score ascending — worst accounts first.

**Jon says:** "This is the whole firm. Sorted by health. The accounts at the top are the ones your team should look at first thing Monday morning. Right now, your team doesn't know which accounts to prioritize. Min does."

**Click:** Jon hovers over a green account (score: 96). "This account is clean. No action needed." Then hovers over a red account (score: 54). "This one has five open issues. Without Min, both accounts look the same in your CRM."

**Goal:** Trust. The firm-level view proves this scales. It's not one account — it's every account. The attendee thinks: "I have 400 accounts. How many of them are at 54?"

---

## Seconds 150-180: The Close

**Screen:** Jon leaves the demo on the firm-level view — it's the most provocative screen.

**Jon says:** "Here's what I'd like to do. We can connect Min to your custodial data in about two weeks. Within 48 hours of connection, you'll see every issue hiding in your book — just like this, but with your real accounts. No commitment, no cost for the pilot. We just need a 20-minute call to set it up. Do you have time next week?"

**Goal:** A scheduled follow-up. Not "here's my card." Not "check out our website." A specific date and time for a call. Jon pulls out his phone and opens his calendar. The physical act of opening the calendar creates social momentum — the attendee opens theirs too.

---

---

# PART 4: WHAT THE BOOTH REVEALED ABOUT THE PRODUCT

---

## 1. The 10-Second Test

**Did the signage stop the right people?**
Yes. Karen (COO, $300M), Diana (CCO, $2B), and Priya (COO, $400M) all stopped because of the signage or attract screen. The phrase "your ops team" filtered effectively — advisors like David stopped too, but for the right reason (curiosity about their ops team's world, leading to internal championship).

**Did it also stop the wrong people?**
Yes. Brad ($40M solo advisor) stopped because the booth was physically open and inviting, not because the signage qualified him out. He doesn't have an "ops team."

**How should the signage change?**
The signage is strong. Don't change the headline. But consider adding a subtle qualifier below the "min.tech" URL: **"For RIA firms with $200M+ AUM"** in small but legible text. This won't stop all tire-kickers, but it gives Jon a natural out: "As you can see on our signage, we're designed for firms at $200M and above."

---

## 2. The Vocabulary Test

| **Word** | **Landed** | **Confused** | **Verdict** |
|---|---|---|---|
| "Hiding" | Karen, Marcus, Priya | Nobody | **Keep.** Universal resonance. |
| "Health score" | Karen, Richard, Priya | David (briefly) | **Keep.** Intuitive enough. |
| "Signal" | Marcus, Diana | David, Brad | **Use carefully.** Say "issue" or "problem" at the booth. Reserve "signal" for technical conversations. |
| "NIGO" | Karen, Diana | David, Brad, Richard | **Don't use at the booth.** Say "missing paperwork" or "incomplete forms." NIGO is insider jargon. |
| "Orchestration" | Nobody asked | — | **Don't use.** Not once in 8 interactions did anyone respond to this word. It's too abstract. Kill it from booth vocabulary. |
| "Triage" | Marcus | Brad | **Use selectively.** Ops people understand it. Others don't. Default to "priority queue." |
| "Write-back" | Marcus, Priya | — | **Keep for technical conversations.** Don't lead with it. |
| "Audit trail" | Diana, Karen, Priya | Nobody | **Keep.** Universal. Powerful. Compliance buyers light up. |
| "Provenance" / "Source attribution" | Marcus | Others | **Say "we show you where the data came from."** Plain English beats jargon. |

---

## 3. The Feature Hierarchy

Ranked by reaction strength across all 8 attendees:

1. **Automated detection of issues from custodial data** — Every single attendee reacted to this. It's the core value. Lead with it always.

2. **Source attribution / "where the data came from"** — Karen, Diana, Marcus, and Priya all leaned in when Jon showed the provenance line. It's the trust mechanism. Show it in every demo.

3. **The audit trail** — Diana (CCO) made this her entire conversation. Karen and Priya valued it. Compliance buyers see this as THE product. Ops buyers see it as a bonus.

4. **Account health score** — Good as an organizing principle and visually effective. But it was the detection underneath the score that generated excitement, not the score itself.

5. **Firm-level view (sorted by health)** — Richard (CEO/M&A) and Priya responded strongly. It communicates "we see your whole firm."

6. **Multi-custodial capability** — Marcus and Priya specifically valued this. It's the competitive moat. But it's a differentiator, not a hook. Lead with detection; multi-custodial is the "and it works across all your custodians" kicker.

7. **Two-week implementation** — Marcus's eyes moved when Jon said this. It's a sleeper differentiator. Most RIA technology takes 3-6 months. Two weeks is disruptive.

8. **Write-back** — Only resonated with technically sophisticated attendees (Marcus, Priya). For most booth visitors, "detect and document" is enough. Write-back is a follow-up conversation feature.

**What fell flat:**
- The before/after "The Save" screen (Screen C) on the attract monitor. David responded to it, but it's the weakest of the three attract screens. The problem/solution dichotomy is too generic — it could be any product. Replace with a compliance-focused screen showing a complete audit trail.

## 4. The Qualification Test

**Fastest self-qualification signal:** **"How many custodians does your firm use?"**

If the answer is 2+, they're in Min's sweet spot. If the answer is 1, they might still qualify but the multi-custodial value prop is diminished.

**Second qualifier:** **"Who handles account openings and transfers at your firm?"**

If they say a name ("Janet," "our ops team"), they have dedicated ops staff — they're qualified. If they say "I do" or "my assistant," they're likely too small.

**Third qualifier (implicit):** Firm size. If they say $200M+, continue. Under $200M, gracefully redirect.

**Qualification script (15 seconds):**

Jon: "Tell me about your firm — how many custodians are you on?"
[If 2+]: "And you have a dedicated ops team?"
[If yes]: "Perfect — let me show you what we do for firms exactly like yours."
[If 1 custodian or no ops team]: "Got it. Min is really built for the multi-custodial complexity that hits at $200M+. Here's a one-pager — if that's where you're headed, reach out."

## 5. The Competitive Test

**What Megan (Practifi rep) learned:**
- Min positions as "detection layer" vs. CRM "workflow layer"
- Min uses custodial file feeds and APIs
- Small user base, in pilot 6 months
- Write-back capability exists
- Multi-custodial is the core value prop

**What she couldn't learn:**
- Specific customer names or firms
- The actual data architecture and signal detection algorithms
- Implementation specifics beyond "two weeks"
- Pricing

**What Jon should say differently:**

1. **Don't reveal data architecture.** Replace "file feeds and APIs" with "we have deep integrations with the major custodians."
2. **Don't say "small cohort" or "pilot."** Replace with "we're in production with firms across the $200M-$2B range."
3. **Don't demonstrate write-back to unknown visitors.** Save it for qualified, identified prospects.
4. **When asked "how does this compare to [competitor]?"** respond: "We're complementary. Min handles the detection and intelligence layer. Your CRM handles the relationship and workflow layer. We make your CRM smarter."

## 6. The Objection Map

Ranked by frequency across 8 interactions:

| **Rank** | **Objection** | **Frequency** | **One-Sentence Response** |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | "Is this real or vaporware?" | 4/8 (Priya, Diana, David, Marcus) | "Connect us to your custodial data for a week — we'll show you what we find in your real accounts, not demo data." |
| 2 | "What about false positives / noise?" | 2/8 (Priya, implied by Marcus) | "High-severity signals have near-zero false positives; we're building a suppression layer for timing-related noise in the lower tiers." |
| 3 | "Does it integrate with my CRM?" | 2/8 (Brad, Megan) | "Min works alongside your CRM — we're the intelligence layer that feeds it, and CRM integrations are in development." |
| 4 | "We already track this in spreadsheets." | 2/8 (Karen, implied) | "Min replaces your Monday report with continuous monitoring — every hour, every account, every custodian." |
| 5 | "Can it produce compliance documentation?" | 1/8 (Diana) | "Every action creates a timestamped, attributed audit trail exportable by account, issue type, date range, or handler." |
| 6 | "We're only on one custodian." | 1/8 (implied) | "Min still adds value on a single custodian — the detection layer works the same — but the ROI explodes with multi-custodial complexity." |
| 7 | "What does it cost?" | 1/8 (Brad) | "Pricing is based on firm size and custodian setup — we can discuss specifics on a follow-up call once you've seen it with your data." |

## 7. The Follow-Up Strategy

| **Attendee** | **Lead Quality** | **Follow-Up** |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Karen (COO, $300M) | **A — Hot** | Scheduled demo Tuesday 2pm. Send calendar invite same day. Prep multi-custodial demo with beneficiary detection prominently featured. |
| 2. David (Advisor, $150M) | **C — Internal Champion** | No direct follow-up. The follow-up comes when Lauren (his ops person) calls — if she does. Add to "referred by advisor" list for tracking. If no contact in 2 weeks, send David a gentle email: "Did Lauren get a chance to look at the one-pager?" |
| 3. Brad ($40M solo) | **D — Not Qualified** | No follow-up. Add to mailing list only if he subscribed. |
| 4. Megan (Practifi rep) | **N/A — Competitor** | No follow-up. Document competitive intelligence gathered (what she asked, what Jon revealed). Update competitive defense playbook. |
| 5. Diana (CCO, $2B) | **A — Hot** | Scheduled demo Wednesday. Prep compliance-focused demo: lead with audit trail, SEC documentation, fee supervision detection. Send compliance-specific one-pager in advance. |
| 6. Marcus (Tech Consultant) | **B — Strategic** | Send technical overview doc within 24 hours (as promised). Follow up in 1 week with a 15-minute call offer. If he's interested, offer a deep-dive technical session. Getting Min on his recommendation list is worth 10 direct sales. |
| 7. Richard (CEO, $500M, M&A) | **A — Hot, Urgent** | Call Monday (as he requested). He may want to move very fast. Prep M&A-oriented positioning: "operational due diligence," "documented operational maturity," "acquirer-ready health reports." |
| 8. Priya (COO, $400M, LinkedIn follower) | **A+ — Hottest** | Scheduled 45-min demo Thursday 10am ET with her 3 ops team members. Send calendar invite same day with agenda. Prep tri-custodial demo. Be explicit about Pershing limitations. She values honesty over polish. |

**Summary:** 4 hot leads, 1 strategic lead, 1 internal champion, 1 competitor, 1 unqualified. That's a 50% hot-lead rate from booth traffic — exceptional for a conference booth.

# PART 5: BOARD AND OPS TEAM REVIEW

---

## Board of Advisors Review

### Is T3 the right go-to-market channel for Min's current stage?

**Board Consensus: Yes, with caveats.**

T3 is where RIA technology purchasing decisions begin. 60%+ of RIA software evaluations start with a conference interaction. Min's absence from T3 would be a positioning gap — it signals "not serious" to consultants like Marcus and firms like Priya's that are actively evaluating.

**Caveats:**
- Min should attend T3 not to generate 50 leads but to generate 5-8 exceptional ones. The goal is quality, not quantity. The simulation produced 4 hot leads and 1 strategic lead from 8 interactions — that's a realistic day.
- The booth should be treated as a brand-building exercise as much as a lead-generation one. Marcus seeing Min at T3 validates it as a real product. Diana seeing it validates the compliance angle. Richard seeing it opens the M&A conversation. These aren't just leads — they're positioning events.

### Does the 3-minute demo communicate the right things?

**Board Assessment: Mostly yes. One risk.**

The demo communicates detection, intelligence, and trust (via source attribution). Those are the right things. The risk is that the demo doesn't communicate implementation ease. Multiple attendees asked "what's the catch?" in different ways. The "two weeks, no IT project" line should be in the demo script, not just in response to questions.

**Recommendation:** Add a brief implementation mention in the Seconds 150-180 close: "We connect to your custodial data in two weeks — no middleware, no IT project."

### Cost-benefit of conference attendance vs. other channels?

**Board Analysis:**

| **Channel** | **Cost** | **Expected Leads** | **Cost per Qualified Lead** | **Time to Revenue** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T3 Conference | $15-25K (booth + travel + collateral) | 4-8 hot leads per conference | $2,500-$5,000 | 2-4 months |
| Direct Outreach (email/LinkedIn) | $2-5K/month (tools + time) | 1-3 hot leads per month | $1,500-$3,000 | 3-6 months |
| Consultant Partnerships | $5-10K (relationship building) | 5-15 referrals per year | $500-$1,500 | 4-8 months |
| Content Marketing (LinkedIn) | $1-2K/month (Jon's time) | 1-2 inbound per month | $500-$1,000 | 1-3 months |

**Recommendation:** Do T3, but don't over-index on it. T3 is the credibility event. LinkedIn content + consultant relationships are the volume engine. The ideal sequence: LinkedIn content creates awareness (Priya), T3 converts awareness to demos, consultant relationships (Marcus) create scaled distribution.

### Likely conversion rate?

**Board Estimate:**
- Booth visit → Scheduled demo: 50% (4/8 in simulation)
- Scheduled demo → Pilot: 40-50%
- Pilot → Paying customer: 60-70% (Min's "find issues in your data" approach is high-conversion)
- **Overall: Booth visit → Customer: ~15-20%**

At 20-30 booth visits per conference day, that's 3-6 customers from a single conference. At an ACV of $20-50K, that's $60-300K in ARR from a $20K investment. **The ROI is strong if the booth is well-executed.**

### T3 vs. smaller regional events?

**Board Recommendation: Both, sequenced.**

Do T3 in 2025 for credibility and to generate the initial customer stories. Then use those stories at regional events (FPA chapter meetings, local advisor study groups, custodian-hosted technology days) where the audience is smaller but the conversations are deeper. Regional events are where Jon can spend 15-20 minutes per person instead of 3 minutes. The combination of T3 (brand + leads) and regional events (depth + conversion) is more effective than either alone.

## Operating Team Review

### Elena (Product/Design) — Attract Mode Screen Revisions

**Current rotation:** The Wall (triage queue) → The X-Ray (account health) → The Save (before/after)

**Recommended revision:**

1. **Keep "The Wall" as Screen A.** It's the strongest attract screen. No changes.

2. **Keep "The X-Ray" as Screen B.** Add a subtle animation: when the screen loads, the health score counts up from 0 to 72, and signals appear one at a time. This creates motion that catches peripheral vision.

3. **Replace "The Save" (Screen C) with "The Trail."** A compliance-focused screen showing a complete audit trail for a resolved issue — 5 timestamped entries from detection to resolution. This serves the Diana persona (compliance) and proves the product is real (not just dashboards but documentation). The before/after was too generic.

4. **Add a fourth screen: "The Firm."** The firm-level view sorted by health score — worst accounts floating to the top. This is the screen Richard (M&A) and Marcus (consultant) responded to most. It communicates scale.

**Rotation timing:** 15 seconds per screen (not 20). Attendees walk fast. The full loop should complete in 60 seconds.

### Omar (Engineering) — Conference Demo Build Punch List

**Must-have for T3:**

| **Priority** | **Item** | **Status** | **Why** |
|---|---|---|---|
| P0 | Demo environment with realistic fictional data | Build | Cannot demo with pilot customer data at a public booth |
| P0 | Attract mode loop (4 screens, 15-sec rotation, auto-restart) | Build | The attract screen is the primary traffic driver |
| P0 | Account health score drilldown with source attribution | Verify working | This is the core demo moment (Seconds 40-90 in the script) |
| P0 | Audit trail view with 5+ entries per issue | Verify working | Compliance demo requires this (Diana persona) |
| P0 | Firm-level view sorted by health score | Verify working | The "proof" moment (Seconds 120-150) |
| P1 | Fee mismatch detection with ADV cross-reference | Verify working | Second-strongest demo moment; compliance hook |
| P1 | Multi-custodian badge on each signal (shows which custodian) | Build | Visual proof of multi-custodial capability |
| P1 | Offline fallback — demo must work without internet | Build | Conference WiFi is unreliable. Demo cannot depend on a live API call |
| P2 | Export audit trail as PDF | Build | Diana asked "can I export this?" — must be demoable |
| P2 | Pershing signal latency indicator (show 4hr vs real-time) | Build | Priya asked about this — honesty in the demo builds trust |

### Rachel (Operations/GTM) — Pre-Conference Rehearsal Checklist

**Jon must rehearse:**

1. **The 3-minute demo script** — 20 full run-throughs before the conference. Time each one. It should be exactly 3 minutes, not 3:30.

2. **The one-liner** — "We find the operational problems hiding in your book before they become client problems." Say it in the mirror 50 times until it's muscle memory.

3. **The qualification sequence** — "How many custodians? Who handles ops? What's your AUM?" Practice transitioning gracefully from qualification to demo (qualified) or to one-pager handoff (not qualified).

4. **The graceful disengage** — "Min is really built for the $200M-plus range where multi-custodial complexity gets overwhelming. Here's a one-pager — when you scale up, we'd love to talk." Practice saying this warmly, not dismissively.

5. **The competitive deflection** — "We're complementary. Min is the intelligence layer between your custodians and your existing tools." Practice this for Practifi, Orion, Salesforce, and "do you compete with [X]?" questions.

6. **The flipped-badge protocol** — "Happy to give you an overview — can I see your badge?" Practice asking this naturally, not suspiciously.

7. **The compliance pitch** — For CCOs: lead with audit trail, not health scores. Practice the Diana interaction specifically.

8. **The M&A pitch** — For CEOs: lead with "prove your operational maturity." Practice the Richard interaction.

**Edge cases to prepare for:**

- "Is this AI?" → "Min uses intelligent automation to read custodial data and detect patterns. It's not a chatbot — it's a monitoring system."
- "What about data security?" → "Your data never leaves your environment / our SOC 2 compliant infrastructure. We can discuss the security architecture on a follow-up call."
- "We're already with [Orion/Practifi/Salesforce], we don't need another tool." → "Min works alongside [tool]. It makes [tool] smarter by feeding it information it doesn't have today."
- "Can you do billing?" → "Min detects billing discrepancies. It doesn't generate bills. It tells you when something's wrong with the bills your existing system generates."
- "We're only at one custodian." → "Min still adds value on a single custodian — we detect issues in account data regardless. But the ROI accelerates with multi-custodial complexity."

### Rachel — Lead Capture and Follow-Up Workflow

**At the booth — capture:**

Sarah carries a notepad (physical, not digital — faster, less awkward). For each meaningful interaction:
- Name (from badge)
- Title
- Firm name
- AUM (if mentioned)
- Custodians (if mentioned)
- One sentence: what they cared about most
- Outcome: Scheduled demo / Took card / Took one-pager / Not qualified / Competitor

**Within 2 hours of booth closing — digitize:**

Enter all notes into a spreadsheet/CRM. Categorize:
- **A leads** (scheduled demo) — get calendar invites sent THAT NIGHT
- **B leads** (took card, expressed interest, no demo scheduled) — email within 24 hours
- **C leads** (internal champions, curious advisors) — email within 48 hours with "share with your ops team" framing
- **D leads** (not qualified) — mailing list only
- **Competitors** — document in competitive intelligence file

**Follow-up cadence:**

**Day 0 (night of interaction):**
- A leads: Calendar invite with agenda for scheduled demo
- All leads: Personal email from Jon: "Great meeting you at T3. Here's the one-pager I mentioned. [One-pager PDF attached]" — 3 sentences max, personalized with the one thing they cared about.

**Day 3:**
- A leads: Reminder email with "looking forward to our call on [day]." Include a 1-minute product video as a teaser.
- B leads: "Wanted to follow up from T3. Would a 20-minute demo be useful? Here's my calendar link."
- C leads: "I thought your [COO/ops team] might find this useful — here's a 2-minute video showing what Min does." (This is the forwarding-optimized email.)

**Day 7:**
- A leads: Post-demo follow-up (if demo has occurred). Pilot proposal.
- B leads: Second touch. "One thing I didn't get to show you at the booth — [specific feature based on their interest]. Worth 15 minutes?"
- C leads: No second touch. If the internal champion pathway hasn't activated by Day 7, it's unlikely to.

**Day 14:**
- A leads who haven't converted: "Checking in — happy to answer any questions from the team."
- All others: Add to monthly newsletter (if they opted in).

# 10 TAKEAWAYS FROM THE CONFERENCE TEST

**Ordered by impact:**

**1. "How does it know?" is the ideal first question.** If your attract screen and one-liner make someone ask "how does it know?" instead of "what does it do?", you've communicated the *what* successfully. The entire booth should be optimized to generate this question.

**2. Detection is the hook. Audit trail is the closer.** Lead every demo with "we find problems you didn't know about." Close every demo with "and we document everything automatically." Detection generates excitement. The audit trail generates trust and urgency (especially for compliance buyers).

**3. Kill "orchestration" from booth vocabulary immediately.** Not one person in 8 interactions responded to this word. It's abstract, it's tech-speak, and it sounds like every other SaaS product. Say "finds," "detects," "monitors," or "catches." These are concrete verbs that communicate action.

**4. The fee mismatch is the universal concern.** It's the one signal that resonated with EVERY persona — the COO (operational risk), the advisor (career risk), the CCO (compliance risk), the CEO (acquisition risk). Build every demo around a fee mismatch example, with the beneficiary designation as the emotional kicker.

**5. "Two weeks, no IT project" is a stealth differentiator.** Say it in every interaction. RIA technology implementations are legendary nightmares. Min's speed-to-value story is disruptive and no competitor can match it.

**6. Qualify in 15 seconds or lose real prospects.** The Brad interaction cost Jon two qualified leads. The qualification script — "How many custodians? Who handles ops?" — should be delivered before the demo starts, not after. Disqualifying gracefully is a kindness, not a rejection.

**7. Compliance is a standalone sales motion, not a secondary benefit.** Diana's interaction revealed that CCOs see Min as a fundamentally different product than COOs do. COOs see "operational efficiency." CCOs see "continuous supervisory documentation." Both are right. Consider compliance-specific marketing materials.

**8. The M&A angle is unexpectedly powerful.** Richard's interaction revealed a buyer persona nobody planned for: the CEO preparing for acquisition. "Min proves your operations are excellent" is a value proposition measured in multiples, not saved hours. Develop this messaging track.

**9. LinkedIn is the awareness engine; the booth is the conversion point.** Priya — the hottest lead of the day — came because of a LinkedIn post. The booth confirmed what LinkedIn promised. The ideal marketing motion: LinkedIn creates interest, T3 converts interest to demos, demos convert to pilots. Invest in LinkedIn content before investing in a bigger booth.

**10. "Show me the messiest part" is the best thing a prospect can say.** Priya's request forced honesty, which built trust, which accelerated the sale. Sophisticated buyers don't want perfection — they want to see that you know your product's limitations. Prepare to show rough edges deliberately. Vulnerability is a sales strategy.

---

# THE 3 SENTENCES

**1. The sentence that stops foot traffic (for the signage):**

> **"Your ops team is drowning. Min sees why."**

**2. The sentence that hooks a qualified prospect (Jon's opener):**

> **"We find the operational problems hiding in your book before they become client problems."**

**3. The sentence that closes for a follow-up (Jon's ask):**

> **"Let us connect to your data for two weeks — we'll show you every issue hiding in your book. No commitment, no cost. When can we set that up?"**

---

*These three sentences should be tested, refined, and memorized. They are Min's verbal interface at its most compressed. Every word was earned by the 8 interactions above. Change them only when a real interaction proves a word doesn't work.*
